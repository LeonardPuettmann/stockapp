# About 
I wanted to create a tool to easily analyze news headlines to get a feel on how the market is doing. I deployed this app on http://turtleshell.io/.  

A simple web app based on the streamlit framework. This app can be used to select stock and to get a sentiment score of current news headlines and a (probably not so accurate) prediction of the price. 
Feel free to take this Repo and change it however you like!
